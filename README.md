# VR-Witnessing-Gaza-A-Walk-Through-Sorrow

In light of the ongoing tragedy in Gaza, we have decided to create a VR experience that brings attention to the struggles faced by the people of Gaza. This project aims to offer users an immersive journey through the raw emotions of loss, fear, anger, and pain experienced by the resilient souls of Gaza. By delving deeper into the complexities of human struggle beyond media representations, we hope to foster empathy, understanding, and awareness.

Problem Statement:
Ongoing crisis in Gaza has resulted in immense suffering and loss for its inhabitants.  However, mainstream media often fails to convey the full extent of these hardships, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy among global audiences. Despite widespread awareness of the crisis in Gaza, many individuals lack a deep understanding of the day-to-day realities faced by its residents. 
This disconnect between awareness and understanding hinders efforts to advocate for meaningful change and support for the people of Gaza.
