# VR-Witnessing-Gaza-A-Walk-Through-Sorrow

In light of the ongoing tragedy in Gaza, we have decided to create a VR experience that brings attention to the struggles faced by the people of Gaza.

This project aims to offer users an immersive journey through the raw emotions of loss, fear, anger, and pain experienced by the resilient souls of Gaza. 

By delving deeper into the complexities of human struggle beyond media representations, we hope to foster empathy, understanding, and awareness.
